# London Housing Data Analysis

This repository contains code and data files for analyzing London housing data. The data was collected from the London House Prices dataset by Justin Cirtautas [(check it here)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/justinas/house-prices-in-london/notebook) and contains information on housing prices, sales, and other related factors.

To ensure that the code runs correctly, it is recommended to set up a virtual Python environment.

You can use the following steps to set up a virtual environment using venv:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window


2. Navigate to the project directory


3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

<br>

    python3 -m venv housing-project
    
    
4. Activate the virtual environment by running the following command:
<br>

    source housing-project/bin/activate
    
    
5. Install the required packages by running the following command:


<br>

    pip install 'package-name'
    
After setting up the virtual environment, you can run the code in the Jupyter notebook or using Python scripts.
